 * Base class for integration tests that need a real, running PostgreSQL database.
 *
 * <p>A single {@link PostgreSQLContainer} is started once, in a static initializer, and shared by
 * every test class that extends this one (the "singleton container" pattern), instead of one
 * container being started per test class. The container is never stopped explicitly: Testcontainers'
 * Ryuk reaper removes it automatically once the JVM exits.
 *
 * <p>This container is strictly local, ephemeral and disposable — it runs entirely inside Docker on
 * the developer/CI machine and holds no data of value. It must never be pointed at Neon, or at any
 * other real/remote database: {@link ServiceConnection} makes Spring Boot wire the
 * datasource/JPA/Flyway configuration to this container automatically, which is what guarantees that
 * tests never fall back to the {@code DB_URL} placeholder declared in {@code application.yml}.
